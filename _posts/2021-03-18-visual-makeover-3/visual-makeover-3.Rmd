# 1. Introduction

This post is part of the submission for ISSS608 DataViz Makeover assignment 3. Data visualisation critique and makeover is done on [South-east Asia Armed Conflict Analysis dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/profile/tskam#!/vizhome/South-eastAsiaArmedConflictAnalysis/South-eastAsiaArmedConflictAnalysis).

The [data](http://github......./) is extracted from The Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (ACLED) database for Southeast Asia region between 2010 and 31 October 2020. More info about ACLED can be found [here](https://acleddata.com/about-acled/).

The assessment criteria will be similar to the previous blog post, based on the clarity and aesthetic aspect of the visualisation (taking reference from ["Data Visualization: Clarity or Aesthetics?"](https://dataremixed.com/2012/05/data-visualization-clarity-or-aesthetics/) by Ben Jones). In addition, since the dashboard is meant to be interactive, we will also assess its interactive feature based on utility.

# 2. Critique and suggestion

The screenshot of original dashboard that will be assessed is shown below.
